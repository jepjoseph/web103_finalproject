## About

### Description and Purpose

Local Bloom is a community exploration platform designed to help creatives and locals discover independent art businesses, craft supply shops, cozy cafes, indie bookstores, or hands-on creative workshops. Many unique small businesses and local craft gatherings lack high-visibility marketing channels and get buried by large commercial chains on conventional map services. CraftSpot solves this by providing a curated directory where users can search, explore, and filter hidden gems by activity type, distance, and budget tier ($ to $$$). Users can view comprehensive details about each location or event, while business owners and event organizers can list their venues and post upcoming workshops.

### Inspiration

As makers and art enthusiasts, finding affordable materials and local creative workshops often requires digging through fragmented social media posts, scattered forums, or word-of-mouth recommendations. We wanted to build a centralized, community-driven hub that bridges the gap between independent artisans and local residents looking for creative outlets. By spotlighting small, independent businesses—from pottery studios and secondhand craft supply stores to indie bookstores hosting open mic nights—CraftSpot fosters local creative economies and makes hands-on arts accessible to everyone.
